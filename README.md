# ChartQA

## Dataset
The ChartQA dataset is available in the ChartQA Dataset folder in this repository. You can also download it from the following google drive link: [ChartQA Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lm_w6zeET1Hyl_9ks6w5nEsgpoyPHalV/view?usp=sharing)

The dataset has three folder for the different splits (train, validation, and test). Each one of these folders contain two subfolders: png and tables which contain the chart images and the underlying data tables. Each split folder also has two json files: split_human (the human-authored questions) and split_augmented (the machine-generated questions). We will be releasing the additional chart images annotations (e.g., bounding boxes of the chart elements) soon.
